 In this project I tried to replicate the famous delivery giant Zomato as a learning project. 
 
 Html and CSS is used in the construction of the site completly. 
 Included many pages depending upon the nav links. 
 Page includes one Hero section and other sections that includes different varities the food giant is offering.
 It also includes play and App store links to download the app in one of the section of the main page.
 
 I tried to make it the exact replica of the original site with only HTML and CSS.
